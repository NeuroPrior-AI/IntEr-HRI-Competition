# IntEr-HRI_Competition
This repository contains useful example code and meta-information about the online part and data streaming of the IntEr-HRI competition. <br>
The file *receive_data_chunks.py* contains an example code on how the EEG data can be accessed using LSL (via pylsl) and the prediction of errors are sent to a provided API. For further information refer to the website of the competition (https://ijcai-23.dfki-bremen.de/competitions/inter-hri/). <br> 
The repository also contains the *LiveAmpIjcai.cfg* config file for the data stream. It provides useful information about the streamed data, especially the names of the 64 EEG channels as well as the used sampling rate.
